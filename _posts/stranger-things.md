If you are as persnickety as I am when it comes to your coding setup, I would recommend the Stranger Things theme. You can find this as a VSCode extension. The show is alright, but I love the way the code looks and I tried probably too many themes before I found something I like.

As I have transitioned careers, I am not a coding lifer, nor do I have a computer science degree. Those with more experience may say there is too much red and green, but I am the one who has to stare at it all day and I love this one. As far as Icons go
