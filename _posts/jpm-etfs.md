Jamie Dimon, a notable figure in the financial world, has been vocal about his skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, citing concerns over their use in illegal activities such as money laundering, fraud, tax evasion, and funding illicit trades like sex trafficking. Amidst these criticisms, there's an observable rush among Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan, to secure regulatory green lights for launching their own Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).

ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep the trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur. The financial industry's eagerness to introduce cryptocurrency ETFs seems to be influenced by a strategy to enter the market at lower price points, potentially keeping cryptocurrency values subdued in the interim.

The introduction of these ETFs is poised to benefit banks significantly for multiple reasons. Notably, the management fees associated with these ETFs represent a direct revenue stream. Additionally, the banks' market-making and arbitrage divisions are likely to capitalize on the timing of ETF rebalances, engaging in trades that precede these adjustments. This activity could impose an indirect cost on investorsâ€”an "undisclosed tax" that may not be evident unless the ETF's performance is closely monitored against the actual cryptocurrency market over time.

Furthermore, banks are expected to leverage their cryptocurrency holdings by engaging in secured lending on the blockchain, akin to the practices observed in global bond and equity markets through repurchase agreements and securities lending for short selling. This maneuver will allow banks to earn substantial returns, estimated between 6-8%, by lending out their significant cryptocurrency portfolios. Unfortunately, this additional income, or "carry," will bypass ETF investors, flowing instead directly into the banks' coffers, highlighting a lucrative but less transparent aspect of cryptocurrency ETF management.
